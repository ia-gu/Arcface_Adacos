# Arcface_Adacos
The repository contains implementations of [Arcface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07698.pdf) and [AdaCos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.00292.pdf).
Few-Shot human recognition of LFW dataset with using Arcface and AdaCos.

This is one of my final tasks in my third year.

Arcface is forked from [here](https://github.com/penguinone-cv/Arcface)

AdaCos is forked from [here](https://github.com/4uiiurz1/pytorch-adacos)
